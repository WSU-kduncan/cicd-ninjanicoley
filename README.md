Project Overview

Part 1: Run Project Locally

1. How was Docker and it's dependencies installed?

I went to docker .com/get-started and downloaded docker for Mac. 
I did need to find a version of Docker that would run on Mac Catilina 
10.15.6 since my Mac is not up-to-date in order to run the latest version of docker. 

2. How to build the container?

From there, I followed the tutorial that accompanied the download for docker and used the terminal that was apart of the docker GUI. 

3. How to run the container?

I used the command: docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started to get the docker image to run in the browser.

4. How to view the project? (open a browser, go to ip and port...)
